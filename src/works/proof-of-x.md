A landmark exhibition redefining blockchain technology as an artistic medium, held at Daikanyama Hillside Forum in June 2023. Organized around ten thematic threads — from "Code as Art" and "On-chain / Off-chain" to "Decentralized Curation" — the show brought together artists such as Rhea Myers, exonemo, Matt Kane, and 0xDEAFBEEF, shifting the conversation around crypto art in Japan from speculation to critical discourse on expression and systems.
