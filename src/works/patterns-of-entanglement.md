An international exhibition exploring media ecologies and the entanglement of human and non-human systems. Held at NEORT++ in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, the show brought together ten artists — including Libby Heaney, Kazuhiro Tanimoto, and Gretchen Andrew — to examine the complex interplay between digital, natural, and non-human agents (AI, flora, machines) from the perspective of media ecology.
